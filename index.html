				<h4>What is an <i>Antique</i>?:</h4>
				<p>
					According to <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antique" target="_blank">Merriam-Webster Dictionary</a>, an antique is something that has existing since or belonging to earlier times. This is a very vague description however (thanks Merriam-Webster), A more widely accepted deffinition of antiques is an object that has gained value because of it being older than one century. Most of the antiques in my collection are not that old but are still considered by many to be antiques simply because of their age and rarity.

				<h2><u>What Is This Site?</u></h2>
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I grew up wondering 'what is the oldest thing in the world?' after learning every atom on this planet has been around since the beginning of time, I adjusted my question to be 'what is the oldest object created by humman-kind?' This and the suggestions from my family, lead me to discover antiques. When you look at something older than 100 years, you are looking at a sliver of history. The places this item have traveled and the people who have had it in their posession by that point may be quite numerable. Each owner and each place an antique travels leaves a mark (however small), adding to the item's history.
